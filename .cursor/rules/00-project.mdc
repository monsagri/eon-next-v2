# Cursor Adapter Rule

Use repository guidance from:

1. `AGENTS.md` (canonical)
2. `docs/ai/context.md`
3. `docs/ai/conventions.md`
4. `docs/ai/workflows.md`
5. `docs/ai/checklist.md`

Keep changes small, preserve Home Assistant entity stability, and run local validation commands referenced in `docs/ai/workflows.md`.

Non-negotiable metadata rule: keep `custom_components/eon_next/manifest.json` version aligned with the latest `CHANGELOG.md` version and `.release-please-manifest.json` (when present).
