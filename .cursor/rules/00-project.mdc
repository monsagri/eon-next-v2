# Cursor Adapter Rule

Use repository guidance from:

1. `AGENTS.md` (canonical)
2. `docs/ai/context.md`
3. `docs/ai/conventions.md`
4. `docs/ai/workflows.md`
5. `docs/ai/checklist.md`

Keep changes small, preserve Home Assistant entity stability, and run local validation commands referenced in `docs/ai/workflows.md`.
