# GitHub Copilot Instructions

Follow repository guidance in this order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/ai/context.md`
3. `docs/ai/conventions.md`
4. `docs/ai/workflows.md`
5. `docs/ai/checklist.md`

Key constraints:

- Preserve Home Assistant integration contracts and entity stability.
- Avoid credential/token leakage in logs or code.
- Keep `manifest.json`, `hacs.json`, and release docs aligned when versioning changes.
- Use Conventional Commit format for commits and PR titles.
